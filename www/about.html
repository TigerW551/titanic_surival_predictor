        <h1>About this project</h1>

        <p>The idea came from the Kaggle machine learning competition <a href="http://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted">"Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster"</a>.
        </p>
        <p>As an introductory machine learning project, Kaggle provided neatly organized data of each of the 1200+ Titanic passengers.
        The data include the following fields:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pclass: a proxy for socio-economic status</li>
            <li>Name: full name including title</li>
            <li>Sex</li>
            <li>Age</li>
            <li>SibSp: brother, sister, stepbrother, or stepsister of passenger aboard Titanic; as well as spouse</li>
            <li>Parch: mother or father of passenger aboard Titanic, plus children</li>
            <li>Cabin</li>
            <li>Embarked: port of embarkation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Kaggle data were broken into two sets: a training set and a testing set. The only difference between these two datasets is that in
        the training set data, the survival information of the passenger was given, while the testing dataset it was not. Participants of the
        competition is expected to use the training set to create prediction models, and apply them to the testing set
        to predict the passengers' survival.</p>

        <p>I created multiple models for this competition. Some models have higher accuracy (mostly tree-based), but with obvious trade off of low interpretability. For this
        specific project, I thought it would be fun to let users select individual fields, and tell them how likely they were to survive the instance.
        Logistic Regression model with the Lasso regularization (10-fold cross-validation was used to select the lambda value with the highest
            training set accuracy) method was used for its high accuracy and excellent interpretability. </p>

        <p>The final logistic regression model used for this project has AUC about 88% on the training set, and about 78% out-of-bag accuracy. Some of the
            fields, like cabin letter initial and last name could increase accuracy, but will likely slow down the web experience, thus were not included. The following fields
        were used in the model, all of which have non-zero coefficiencies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pclass</li>
            <li>Sex</li>
            <li>Age</li>
            <li>Fare</li>
            <li>If traveled in group and shared cabin</li>
            <li>Title is Don</li>
            <li>Title is Jonkheer</li>
            <li>Title is Master</li>
            <li>Title is Mr</li>
            <li>Title is Mrs</li>
            <li>Title is Rev</li>
            <li>Title is Sir</li>
            <li>SibSp</li>
            <li>Total family memebers aboard</li>
        </ul>
